# The Jacobian

In the [last post](2016-02-28-thetangentbundle.html), we defined the tangent bundle. 
We have finally developed enough machineary to start seriously doing calculus on 
manifolds. We shall define the derivative of a smooth map between manifolds. We shall 
translate the [implicit function 
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem) into the language of 
differential geometry. 

### Pulling back vector bundles

Suppose that $f : X \to Y$ is a smooth map between manifolds and $E$ is a vector 
bundle on $Y$.

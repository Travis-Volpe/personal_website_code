# Heapsort

In the [last post](2018-04-01-insertion-and-merge-sort.html) we implemented the insertion and merge sort algorithms. Insertion sort has time complexity $O(L^2)$ and space complexity $O(1)$. Merge sort has time complexity $O(L \log L)$ and space complexity $O(L)$. It is natural to ask if there is an array sorting algorithm with time complexity $O(L \log L)$ and space complexity $O(1)$. The heapsort algorithm has these properties, and we shall implement it in this post. All this code and some testing code can be [found](../../CALGO/max_binary_heap/max_binary_heap.c) [here](../../CALGO/max_binary_heap/test.c).

### Max Binary Heaps

We can encode a complete binary tree using an array as follows:
<img src="/img/binary_heap_storage.svg" style="width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
If $i$ is an index, then the parent index is $\left \lfloor i/2 \right \rfloor$, the left child index is $2i$ and the right child index is $2i+1$. This is the fundamental idea behind the max binary heap data structure which we implement as follows:
```{.c}
typedef struct
{
  /* array of pointers */
  void **array;

  /* length of array */
  int length;

  /*
    length of heap. Not all elements in the array are part of the heap.
    The array is array[1..length].
    The heap is array[1..heap_size].
    When heap_size < length, then array[heap_size + 1..length] is extra space.
   */
  int heap_size;

  /*
    compare points to a procedure which computes *ptr1 < *ptr2
   */
  int (*compare)(void *ptr1, void *ptr2);


} heap;
```
The data structure consists of an array $A$ of objects, its length $L$, the length of the heap $H$ and a procedure for comparing objects in the array. Not every element in the array is part of the heap. The heap consists of the entries $A[1..H]$ and the entries $A[H+1..L]$ are extra space. In [CLRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms), arrays are indexed starting at $1$, and for heaps, this makes the bijection between nodes in a complete binary tree and array entries more transparent. For this reason, we don\'t directly index `array`. We use getters and setters instead:
```{.c}
inline void *get(heap *h, int i){ return h->array[i-1];}
inline void *set(heap *h, int i, void *ptr){ return (h->array[i-1]) = ptr;}
```
When heaps are implemented in this way, the tree operations are very simple:
```{.c}
inline int parent(int i){ return i/2;}
inline int left(int i){ return 2*i;}
inline int right(int i){ return 2*i + 1;}
```
One of the key properties we want a max binary heap to satisfy is the max property: For all the objects in $A[1..H]$, we want $A[{\rm parent}(i)] \geq A[i]$. Almost all our computational effort is spent making sure that this property holds using the `max_heapify` procedure:
```{.c}
void max_heapify(heap *h, int i)
{
  int l = left(i);
  int r = right(i);

  int largest;
  void *temp;

  /* determine which is larger out of A[i], A[l], A[r].  */
  if ((l <= h->heap_size) && ( (*h->compare)( get(h,i), get(h,l) ) ) )
    largest = l;
  else largest = i;

  if ((r <= h->heap_size)  && ( (*h->compare)( get(h,largest), get(h,r) ) ) )
    largest = r;


  /* swap A[i] and A[largest] */
  if (largest != i)
    {
      temp = get(h,largest);
      set(h, largest, get(h,i));
      set(h, i, temp);
      max_heapify(h,largest);
    }
}
```
The procedure `max_heapify` assumes that the binary trees rooted at `left(i)` and `right(i)` satisfy the max property, but the object contained at index $i$ might be smaller than its children. It lets $A[i]$ float down until the whole tree rooted at index $i$ satisfies the max property. Since the tree rooted at $i$ has height $\log_2 (H-i)$, the time complexity of this procedure is $O(\log(H-i))$. The space complexity is more subtle. The key point is that `max_heapify` is [tail recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call), so an optimizing compiler will replace the recursion with a loop. Assuming that this is the case, the stack doesn\'t grow while `max_heapify` is executing and only four local variables are instantiated. Therefore, the space complexity for running `max_heapify` is $O(1)$.

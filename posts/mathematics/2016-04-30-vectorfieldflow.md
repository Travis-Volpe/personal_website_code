# Vector Field Flow

In the [last post](2016-03-27-thejacobianmatrix.html), we finally explained how to 
differentiate a smooth map between manifolds, justifying the phrase *a manifolds is a 
space on which one can do calculus*. We have only scratched the surface. There is much 
more to say about manifolds. Before we can go deeper, we need a better understanding 
of vector fields.

# Special Relativity and Minkowski Space

If we measure the speed of light in a vacuum, we always get the same value, independent of the velocity of the light source. The speed of light is a universal constant. This fact has several interesting qualitative consequences. Firstly, choose units so that the speed of light is $1$. Then the time taken for light to travel from $A$ to $B$ is equal to the distance between $A$ and $B$. Secondly, since we learn about the objects around us from the light which bounces of them, we expect our perception of these objects to be distorted if they are moving close to the speed of light. We are going to develop a quantitative understanding of this distortion.

### Spacial distortion perpendicular to velocity

Before we can derive any formulas, we need to understand how spatial measurements get distorted perpendicular to velocity. Suppose that you have a square sheet of metal and you cut out a complicated shape from the middle:

The cut out piece fits perfectly through the hole in the sheet. When objects are moving really fast, their size doesn't change, just our perception of their size does. If the cut out piece is moving fast, parallel to the normal vector of the sheet (which is at rest in our frame of reference), it still fits through the hole. Therefore there cannot be any distortion of distances perpendicular to the velocity.

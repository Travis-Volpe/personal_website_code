#The Basics

I am going to use this blog to record some of my mathematical thoughts. Modern mathematics has a pretty steep learning curve and I don\'t really want to spend my time writing about 
the basics. What are the basics? I could say something like *everything you learn in a standard undergraduate degree*, but that is vague. On this site we shall use the following 
convention: The basics are the material contained in the Appendicies of [Introduction to Smooth Manifolds](https://www.math.washington.edu/~lee/Books/ISM/) by John M Lee. I don\'t 
have any strong opinions about the book as a whole, but the Appendicies line up closely with what I would call *basic* mathematics and they are very well organized.

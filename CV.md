#Daniel Barter

- Date of Birth: November 27, 1989
- Place of Birth: Melbourne, Australia
- Citizenship: Australia

## Education
- B.Sc with First Class Honours and University Medal, Pure Mathematics, University of Sydney, 2008-2011.
- PhD, Pure Mathematics, University of Michigan, 2012 - 2017. Specialized in category theory and representation theory.
- I like to think about: 
    - Pure Mathematics: differential geometry, representation theory and category theory: I am particularly interested in the interaction between these subjects and physics. Recently, I have been thinking about the relationship between modular tensor categories, 3 dimensional topological quantum field theories and topological quantum computing.
    - Statistical Inference: discriminative and generative models, inference algorithms (MAP estimation, MCMC, variational methods): Machine learning is popular right now. I have been spending some time learning about the mathematical foundations of the subject. I don\'t know all the folklore that goes into building effective non linear classifiers, but I understand the meaning of words like neural network, autoencoder, generative model and KL-divergence.
    - Computer Science: UNIX, scripting languages, functional programming: I have been using GNU/Linux as my main operating system since 2012. I have been using scripting languages (Bash, Lua, Emacs Lisp, Python\.\.\.) to automate boring things since 2014. I prefer functional programming, but when mutable state is required, I like languages which have a simple object system like Python. My favourite book about computer science is [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).

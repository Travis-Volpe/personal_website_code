- citizenship: Australia


## Education
- PhD, Pure Mathematics, University of Michigan, 2012 - 2017. Specialized in category theory and representation theory. Thesis: [Some Remarks about the Interaction between Quantum Algebra and Representation Stability.](http://danielbarter.github.io/thesis.pdf)
- B.Sc with First Class Honours and University Medal, Pure Mathematics, University of Sydney, 2008-2011.

## Employment
- University of Michigan. 2012-2016. Graduate student instructor for calculus 1, 2 and 3. Taught classes with 20-30 students, three times a week. Held office hours. Helped students use Mathematica. Graded homework/exams.
- University of Sydney. 2011-2012. Tutor for calculus 1 and 2. Supervised problem sessions and graded homework/exams.

## Independent Study 
- Pure Mathematics: **differential geometry, representation theory and category theory**: I am particularly interested in the interaction between these subjects and physics. Recently, I have been thinking about the relationship between tensor categories, classical representation theory and topological quantum computing.
- Computer Science: **functional programming, assembly, UNIX, machine learning**: I have read [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) and solved all of the exercises. I wrote a [simulator for Knuth\'s MIX machine](http://danielbarter.github.io/mix.html) to learn how computers execute programs. I have been using GNU/Linux as my main operating system since 2012 and am acquainted with the standard tools and how to combine them. I understand the basics of machine learning.

#Daniel Barter

- Citizenship: Australia

## Education
- B.Sc with First Class Honours and University Medal, Pure Mathematics, University of Sydney, 2008-2011.
- PhD, Pure Mathematics, University of Michigan, 2012 - 2017. Specialized in category theory and representation theory.
- I like to think about: 
    - Pure Mathematics: differential geometry, representation theory and category theory: I am particularly interested in the interaction between these subjects and physics. Recently, I have been thinking about the relationship between modular tensor categories, 3 dimensional topological quantum field theories and topological quantum computing.
    - Statistical Inference: discriminative and generative models, inference algorithms (MAP estimation, MCMC, variational methods): Machine learning is popular right now. I have been spending some time learning about the mathematical foundations of the subject. I don\'t know all the folklore that goes into building effective non linear classifiers, but I understand the meaning of words like neural network, autoencoder, generative model and KL-divergence. 
    - Computer Science: functional programming, compilers, UNIX: In 2015 I started reading [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) which got me interested in computer science. Since then I have solved most of the exercises. I have also been reading [Compiler Design: Virtual Machines](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642149085) which beautifully explains the operational semantics of several different programming languages. I have been using GNU/Linux as my main operating system since 2012 and am acquainted with the standard tools and how to combine them.

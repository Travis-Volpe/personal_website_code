#Daniel Barter

- Date of Birth: November 27, 1989
- Place of Birth: Melbourne, Australia
- Citizenship: Australia

## Education
- B.Sc with First Class Honours and University Medal, Pure Mathematics, University of Sydney, 2008-2011.
- PhD, Pure Mathematics, University of Michigan, 2012 - 2017. Specialized in category theory and representation theory.
- Independent Study. I like to think about: 
    - Pure Mathematics: **differential geometry, representation theory and category theory**: I am particularly interested in the interaction between these subjects and physics. Recently, I have been thinking about the relationship between tensor categories, classical representation theory and topological quantum computing.
    - Computer Science: **functional programming, assembly, UNIX, machine learning**: I have read [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) and solved all of the exercises. I wrote a [simulator for Knuth\'s MIX machine](http://danielbarter.github.io/CV.html) to learn how computers execute programs. I have been using GNU/Linux as my main operating system since 2012 and am acquainted with the standard tools and how to combine them. I understand the basics of machine learning.

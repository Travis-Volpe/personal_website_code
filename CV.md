- Date of Birth: November 27, 1989
- Place of Birth: Melbourne, Australia
- Citizenship: Australia

## Education
- B.Sc with First Class Honours and University Medal, Pure Mathematics, University of Sydney, 2008-2011.
- PhD, Pure Mathematics, University of Michigan, 2012 - 2017. Specialized in category theory and representation theory.
- I spend a lot of time learning indipendently. Here are some things I like to think about: 
    - Pure Mathematics: differential geometry, representation theory and category theory. 
    - Statistical Inference: discriminative and generative models, inference algorithms (MAP estimation, MCMC, variational methods).
    - Computer Science: interpreters and compilers, categorical design patterns for functional programming.


## Papers
- Noetherianity and rooted trees. [arXiv:1509.04228](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04228)

## Invited Talks
- Michigan theoretical computer science seminar, *Tensor rank and stability in representation theory*
- Berkeley combinatorics seminar, *Combinatorial categories, configuration spaces and tensorial species*
